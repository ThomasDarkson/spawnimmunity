This mod brings back the 3 seconds of immunity when you spawn.
This "bug" was fixed in 1.21.4 but this mod brings it back and you can even set how long you want to be immune at spawn!

With the game rule `immuneTicks`, you can close this feature or make it even longer. Default value is 60 (20 ticks = 1 second).
